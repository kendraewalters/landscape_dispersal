# landscape_dispersal
Scripts + data for the landscape dispersal project. 

Description of the organization:
"01_Raw_data" contains all the data and metadata used for this experiment. Those files are used in the scripts that are in "02_Scripts_to_process_data". These scripts largely just take the raw data and work it into forms that allow us to make graphs and perform statistics. For example, these scripts may clean out positive and negative controls, rarefy sequences, or calculate needed metrics. The output from those cleaning/processes scripts are stored in "03_Processed_data". This folder contains the cleaned data ready for analysis! Those analyses are done in "04_Scripts_to_make_figures_and_do_stats."
