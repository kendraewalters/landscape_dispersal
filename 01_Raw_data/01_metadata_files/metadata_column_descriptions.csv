Sample_Lost?,"Y if something bad happened during sample production, and the sample was no longer usable."
Random_#_Extractions_Tubes,The random # assigned to that sample when it was extracted with tubes. Note that not all samples were extracted using tubes.
Random_#_Extractions_Plates,The random # assigned to that sample when it was extracted with plates. Note that not all samples were extracted using plates.

Random_#_Flow,The random # assigned to that sample when it was run through the flow cytometer. Note that not all samples were processed for cell abundance. 
Abundance?,Was the sample processed for cell abundance through flow cytometry?
Mass_Loss?,Was the sample processed for mass loss measurement?
Composition?,Was the sample processed for microbial composition?
Numbers,Please ignore this column; this is a remnant of needing to rename samples
